Name:
    ted -- TCPdump's Evolved Descendant

Usage:
    ted
    ted [-r | --rule] attributes [-a |--action] action
    ted [-s | --show]
    ted [-d | --delete]
    ted [-h | --help]

Description:
    Start the program by running without any parameters. The program will disc-
    ard all packets that doesn't match a rule, so to be able to run you have to
    first specify at least one rule.


    [-r | --rule] attributes [-a |--action] action
        Describes what the rule should match against. When several attributes 
        are applied to a rule, a match will only occur when all attributes mat-
        ch their corresponding value. This command will append the rule to the 
        'rules.ted' file. The action will apply to the first rule in the list 
        that matches.

        The action determines what to do when a match happens. The valid actio-
        ns are LOG, DISCARD or ACCEPT. LOG will display the packet to the stan-
        dard output. DISCARD and ACCEPT are used for the API and has no useful 
        functionality from the terminal.

        The valid attributes, and their formats/values, that can be passed thr-
        ough the terminal are as follows:

            ---- Attributes ----               ---- Format/value ----

            --mac-source         <value>         (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
            --mac-destination    <value>         (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
            --network-protocol   <value>         (ipv4 | arp)
            --transport-protocol <value>         (tcp  | udp)
            --ipv4-source        <value>         (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
            --ipv4-destination   <value>         (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
            --port-source        <value>         (0 - 65535)
            --port-destination   <value>         (0 - 65535)


    [-s | --show]
        Print out the current list of rules to standard output.

    [-d | --delete]
        Delete the rules list. All rules will effectively disappear, and new r-
        ules have to created before continuing.

    [-h | --help]
        Print out this help message.
